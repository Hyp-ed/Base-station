Main.java - launches the GUI and the Server
BaseCommunicator.cpp and BaseCommunicator.hpp - contains all the Client code
test.cpp - uses BaseCommunicator functions to send some dummy data to the Server
DummyClient.java - class I wrote in java to test the send and receive functionality of the Server

/*
How to test the Server with the C++ Client 
*/

1.Run the Main.java located in Base-station\Server\src\view\main = javac Main.java
2.Compile and run the test.cpp in Base-station\Client

Expected output: 
The ff values are printed to logs
distance: 6546
velocity: 564
acceleration: 584
stripe count: 964

/*
How to test the Server with the Dummy client Client 
*/

1.Execute the Main.java located in Base-station\Server\src\view\main = javac Main.java
2.Run the DummyClient.java located in Base-station\Server\src = javac DummyClient.java
Note - Dummy Client has code for two tests A and B. To use either you can comment out one and run the class. 
The relevant sections are commented clearly

Expected output(A): 
The ff values are printed to logs
distance: 60
velocity: 60
acceleration: 60
stripe count: 60
rpm fl: 60
rpm fr: 60
rpm bl: 60
rpm br: 60

Expected output(B):
When a button is pressed on the GUI the ff output is produced in the logs of the DummyClient
Received [x] from Server
